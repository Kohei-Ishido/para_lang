README

This is a very basic readme. I will eventally turn this into an HTML document.

How to build.

The following need to be installed in order to make compile the project

Flex++
Bison++
g++ 
make
python 2.7

From there you should just need to run make and the code should build

How to run.

You will need to use program_pipe.py to run your code. program_pipe.py takes an input and output file on the command line as parameters.

thus an example useage would be

python program_pipe.py hello goodbye.cpp

you would then compile goodbye.cpp the following way

g++ goodbye.cpp -msse

This will generate a a.out file which uses paralell code.
